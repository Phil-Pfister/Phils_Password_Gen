# Phils_Password_Gen

This is a Javascript application that generates a random series of between 8 and 128 characters to be used as a password. It was created for demonatration purposes and should not be considered cryptographically secure.

## Discription

When you open the page and click the "generate password" button you are asked to select characteristics for your password such as if you want to use special characters and/or numbers, etc. as well as how long you want the password to be (between 8 and 128 characters). The program then displays a password that matches those inputs.

## Installation

## Credits

I used what I learned in the classroom as well as information from MDN docs and W3 schools websites. I also consulted Stack Overflow and learned about the Durstenfeld Shuffle algorithum. 
I also recieved helpful information from my instructor Brandon Gatlin.
